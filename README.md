### Hi there, I'm Samuel Dayo Adesola 👋

- 🚀 I hold a **B.Eng in Mechatronics and Systems Engineering** with a passion for Robotics, IoT, and Embedded Systems.
- 🤖 I'm a **Robotics Enthusiast** — currently building ROS2-based differential drive robots and exploring autonomous systems.
- 💻 Skilled in **C++**, **Python**, **ROS2**, **Computer Vision**, **Robotics CAD**, and **MATLAB**.
- 🔌 Experienced in **IoT** and **Embedded Systems Development**, I just want to give life to hardware.
- 🛠️ In my free time (which I wish I had more), I do crochet and play Guitar.
